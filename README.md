# Project 1
## Algebraic data types

This project has two parts:

1. Learn to use Scala's `Option` type, representing a value or the lack thereof.
2. Using `Option`, along with some other algebraic data types, to write code to animate the bouncing of a ball in a field with obstacles.

See `Directions.md` in each part for detailed instructions.

## Requirements
* For 1 point: fully complete part 1 and complete step 1 of part 2 (the implementation of the `Point` and `Vector` case classes).
* For 2 points: fully complete parts 1 and 2.
